# Scientific Computing with Python Projects

This folder contains projects completed as part of the Scientific Computing with Python certification. Each project applies Python programming to solve practical mathematical and data-related problems.

## Projects
- Budget App
Simulates a basic budget category ledger. Supports deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. Outputs a spend chart to visualize budget allocation.

- Arithmetic Formatter
Takes a list of arithmetic problems and formats them vertically, similar to how you'd write them  by hand. Includes optional calculation of results.

- Time Calculator
Calculates what time it will be after a certain duration has passed, handling AM/PM transitions and optional weekday tracking.

- Probability Calculator
Uses Monte Carlo simulation to estimate probabilities of drawing specific sets of colored balls from a hat, based on user-defined conditions.

## Purpose
These projects demonstrate core Python skills including:

- Functions and control flow

- Data structures like dictionaries and lists

- String manipulation and formatting

- Simulation and basic probability

- Modular code and clean design


## Running the Projects
clone the repository and navigate into the relevant folder
`git clone https://github.com/Khan1021/Python.git
cd Python/Scientific\ computing
`

## Requirements
Each project can be run independantly. No external libraries are required. Just need Python 3 installation.
