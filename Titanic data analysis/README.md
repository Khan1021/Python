# Aim of programme
The aim of 'Titanic.ex' is to clean, organise and display the dataset.

# Description
'Titanic.ex' shows many visual representations of the different relationships between the variables in the Titanic dataset as well as cleaned tables.
'ex.1' is my development file. This is where I made notes and performed individual tasks in order to learn and apply data analysis tools.

# What did I use
I used Jupyter Notebooks in order for commentary and titles, pandas to create the tables and Seaborn for data visualisation.
